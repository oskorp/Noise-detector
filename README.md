A custom-made app is developed that will start recording when the sound goes above the desired level. The Arduino Nano board Is used to which a Bluetooth receiver ,a sound senso, and a buzzer are connected. The Bluetooth is connected with the smart phone which has the app installed. Once the sound crosses the set value it will start the recording on the smart phone.  Once the level of noise comes down the recording is automatically stopped.
